This seamless experience encourages more prolonged interaction with websites, increasing user retention and content consumption.

## Embracing Monetization Opportunities
For website owners, BApps opens up exciting monetization avenues. By offering their websites as BApps, owners can potentially tap into the Buzz Chat user base, attracting a new stream of visitors and potential customers. This symbiotic relationship benefits both parties: users gain easy access to valuable content, while website owners have the chance to showcase their offerings to a wider audience.
